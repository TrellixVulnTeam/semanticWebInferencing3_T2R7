1. Installing Ruby

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18908708/installing-ruby-gem-in-windows
Run the extra installation at the end to install the DevelopmentKit. If you forgot to do that, run ridk install in your windows console to install it.
https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
Add your Ruby install to User variable "Path"
using control panel, system, Advanced system settings, Environment variables.
For example mine is C:\Ruby24\bin

Doing a "ruby -v" from cmd.exe reveals my current ruby version:
 ruby 2.4.1p111 (2017-03-22 revision 58053) [i386-mingw32]
and I think it was installed using: rubyinstaller-2.4.1-2-x86.exe

2A. https://github.com/ruby-rdf/rdf-reasoner

Does not appear to support Sparql queries so I have skipped this

2B. Librdf

https://www.w3.org/2001/sw/wiki/SemanticWebTools#Ruby_Developers

http://librdf.org/
http://librdf.org/docs/ruby.html
http://download.librdf.org/
http://download.librdf.org/binaries/win32/
http://librdf.org/docs/rdoc/index.html
http://librdf.org/docs/rdoc/Redland/Query.html

http://download.librdf.org/binaries/win32/README.txt
Says that librdf which also support ruby, the windows binaries are old and out of date
So I will not be trying to use librdf

3. http://ruby-rdf.github.io/sparql-client/

This is the method I am using (sparql-client) to do sparql reasoning with Ruby
using a Apache Fuseki endpoint.

After installing ruby and ruby is in the path, from a command prompt (cmd.exe) type:
gem install sparql-client

Then start apache fuseki if not already by running the following batch file:
D:\Programming\apache-jena-fuseki-3.4.0 openllet\fuseki-server.bat

Then run ruby on the program:
In this folder: _github\semanticWebInferencing3\Ruby\sparql-client\
rename runProgram.bat.txt to runProgram.bat and run it

Then look at the output from having run ruby on program1.rb:
In this folder: _github\semanticWebInferencing3\Ruby\sparql-client\
program1-output1.txt
program1-output2.txt

It is not actually necessary to start apache fuseki
and run ruby on the program, since it has already been done,
so it is possible just to look at the two output textfiles from
when I ran it.

To view the ruby source code look at:
In this folder: _github\semanticWebInferencing3\Ruby\sparql-client\
program1.rb
