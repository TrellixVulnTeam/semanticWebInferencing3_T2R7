Says that librdf which also support ruby, the windows binaries are old and out of date
So I will not be trying to use librdf

3. http://ruby-rdf.github.io/sparql-client/

First do:
gem install sparql-client

This is the method I am using (sparql-client) to do sparql reasoning with Ruby
using a Apache Fuseki endpoint.

Run the extra installation at the end to install the DevelopmentKit. If you forgot to do that, run ridk install in your windows console to install it.

Add your Ruby install to PATH! eg C:\Ruby24\bin
