Does not appear to support Sparql queries so I have skipped this

Says that librdf which also support ruby, the windows binaries are old and out of date
So I will not be trying to use librdf

3. http://ruby-rdf.github.io/sparql-client/

After installing ruby and ruby is in the path, from a command prompt (cmd.exe) type:
gem install sparql-client

This is the method I am using (sparql-client) to do sparql reasoning with Ruby
using a Apache Fuseki endpoint.

4. Installing Ruby

Run the extra installation at the end to install the DevelopmentKit. If you forgot to do that, run ridk install in your windows console to install it.
https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/
Add your Ruby install to User variable "Path"
using control panel, system, Advanced system settings, Environment variables.
For example mine is C:\Ruby24\bin

Doing a "ruby -v" from cmd.exe reveals my current ruby version:
 ruby 2.4.1p111 (2017-03-22 revision 58053) [i386-mingw32]
and I think it was installed using: rubyinstaller-2.4.1-2-x86.exe
