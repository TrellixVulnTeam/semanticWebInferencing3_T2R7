1. Install PHP thread safe x64 version for windows

If using it as FastCGI with IIS you should use the Non-Thread Safe,
but I am not using it with IIS so the thread safe should be fine

php-7.2.1-Win32-VC15-x64.zip

http://windows.php.net/download#php-7.2
http://php.net/manual/en/install.windows.legacy.index.php#install.windows.legacy.commandline

I added the location of the php.exe file to the windows path.
Control Panel, System, Advanced system settings, Environment Variables, User Variables - Path, Edit, New: D:\Programming\php-7.2.1-Win32-VC15-x64

2. Install Composer - Dependency Manager for PHP

Composer-setup.exe
